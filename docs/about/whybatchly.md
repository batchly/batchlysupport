#### Why Batchly?
        	
Batchly is a solution that fully automates AWS cost management (using spot instances and instance rightsizing using autoscaling) in a way that makes the ROI impossible to ignore.

AWS has 11 regions with 2 to 3 AZs in each region, 50 instance types, and many instance categories (like Spot, Reserved, and On-demand). Identifying the right infrastructure for your application(s) from these options is not a trivial activity. It is complex, costly, and most times suboptimal.

Batchly takes out all the complexities associated with Cloud management by automating all the activities, resulting in up to 90% reduction in AWS costs.
