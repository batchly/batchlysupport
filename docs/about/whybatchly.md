#### Why Batchly?
        	
Batch.ly is a solution that fully automates AWS cost management (using spot instances and instance rightsizing using autoscaling) in a way that makes the ROI impossible to ignore.

AWS has 11 regions with 2 to 3 AZâ€™s in each region and 50 instance types and many instance categories (like Spot, Reserved, On-demand). Identifying the right infrastructure for your application/s from these options is a non trivial activity. It is complex, costly and most times suboptimal.
