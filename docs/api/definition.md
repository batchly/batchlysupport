Batchly API supports the following entities:

* Jobs
* Runs
* Projects
* Accounts

#### Jobs API

Jobs are calls to perform various operations on the actual dataset. This call varies from one app to another. Though it is app-specific, each job requires jobname, Project, SLA, input location and output location to be mentioned.

Batchly responds immediately with a job ID so your application can track the progress of the job.

**Actions Supported**
