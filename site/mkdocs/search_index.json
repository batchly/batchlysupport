Identifying the right infrastructure for your application/s from these options is a non trivial activity.

No matter what you use AWS for, Batchly helps you to reduce your cost (by up to 90%) in a frictionless manner.\n\n\nFeatures that customers love:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Spot Bid Optimization Seamlessly deploy, move, and manage workloads over high cost savings spot instances across any AWS region.\n\n\nEC2 Instance Smart Sizing Realize ultimate EC2 efficiencies with the automatic instance sizing for the right application / workload.\n\n\nSeamless Integration Easily work with pre-built apps for most common enterprise applications (JMeter, Spark, Hive, PIG, Jenkins, Elastic BeanStalk and more) and REST API support provides a seamless experience.\n\n\nFully Managed Benefit from cost and utilization optimizations from within your own AWS account while we do the heavy lifting.\n\n\nSecure We solved security with organic and strong AWS security controls.",
